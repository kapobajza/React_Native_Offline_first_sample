This is a simple TODO app that demonstrates the offline first approach using [expo](https://expo.dev/), [expo-sqlite](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/sqlite/) and [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest).

## Running the app

To run the app on iOS, in development mode, run the following command:

```bash
